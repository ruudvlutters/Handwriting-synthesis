# Handwriting generation
ML Cleanup of original https://github.com/swechhachoudhary/Handwriting-synthesis

The ML model is implemented from "Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks" by Alex Graves (https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850)

### How to create the environment on your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruudvlutters/Handwriting-synthesis.git```
cd Handwriting-synthesis
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate handwriting
```

### How to train handwriting generation (synthesis) model
```bash
python train.py --n_epochs 120 --model synthesis --batch_size 64 --text_req
```

### How to train handwriting prediction model
```bash
python train.py --n_epochs 120 --model prediction --batch_size 64
```

### Data description:
There are 2 data files that you need to consider: `data.npy` and `sentences.txt`. `data.npy`contains 6000 sequences of points that correspond to handwritten sentences. `sentences.txt` contains the corresponding text sentences. You can see an example on how to load and plot an example sentence in `example.ipynb`. Each handwritten sentence is represented as a 2D array with T rows and 3 columns. T is the number of timesteps. The first column represents whether to interrupt the current stroke (i.e. when the pen is lifted off the paper). The second and third columns represent the relative coordinates of the new point with respect to the last point. Please have a look at the plot_stroke if you want to understand how to plot this sequence.

Samples generated using priming:
* Prime style text is "medical assistance", text after this is generated by model

* Prime style text is "something which he is passing on", text after this is generated by model

* Prime style text is "In Africa Jones hotels spring", text after this is generated by model
